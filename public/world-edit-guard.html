	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
		This is a page about WorldEdit and WorldGuard.
	</p>

	<h2>1. World Edit</h2>

    	<p>
	World edit is the fundamental plugin we used to build this virtual world. It is an editing modification(Mod) developed by software group EngineHub.Reference: <a href="https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest">WorldEdit</a><br />

		    <td>//wand</td>
		    <td>summons the selection wand to your hand</td>
		 </tr>
	</table></center>
	<h4>Making selections</h4>
	A cuboid is like 3D rectangle. In WorldEdit, you select the region that you want by setting two points of a cuboid.<br />

		1.3 Copy and Paste in Minecraft
	</h3>
	<center><table border = "1">
		<tr>
			<th>Command</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>//copy</td>
			<td>
				The //copy command copies your current selection to your session’s clipboard,
				keeping track of where you are relative to the copy. The second part of that
				sentence is very important; if you want to later paste, for example, a bridge
				so that it is under where you are standing, you must stand in a location above
				the bridge when you make the copy. This method allows you to easily align your
				later paste because you can plan ahead a bit; it requires some spatial abilities
				to master the copying process but you will find it particularly helpful once you get the hang of it.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>//paste</td>
			<td>
				Once you have something in your clipboard, you can paste it to the world. The last argument
				is optional: if you want the copy to paste at the same point that it was copied at, type //paste -o,
				otherwise the paste will be placed relative to you.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table></center>

	<h3>1.4 Moving things around</h3>
	<center><table border = "1">
		<tr>
			<th>Command</th>
			<th>Arguments</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>//move</td>
			<td>&#60;direction&#62;</td>
			<td>
				Move every block in the selected region to a direction or based on the player's facing.<br><br>
				You point on the block of the extremity of the diagonal of what you want to select,
				type //hpos1, then point on the block on the other extremity of the diagonal and type
				//hpos2, and then you look in the direction you want to move it, and type //move 50
			</td>

    <h2>2. World Guard</h2>
	<h3>2.1 Creating regions</h3>
	<p>
		All regions must have a name, and names must be unique.
		Names are case-insensitive. Create a region with
		<mark>
			/region define or its shortcut /rg define:
		</mark>
		<br>
		<center>
			<mark>
				/region define town
				<br>
				/rg define town
			</mark>
		</center>
	</p>
	<p>
		The newly created region <b>automatically prevents building</b> within it. To let specific players build, add members or owners to the region. The main reason why you’d have separate owners or members is because you can set <b>permissions to use commands separately for owners and members.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Either players or permission groups can be a member or owner. To specify a permission group, prefix the name of the group with g:. The relevant add and remove commands are illustrated below:
	</p>
	<p>
		<center>
		<mark>
			/rg addmember town Notch sk89q g:builders <br>
			/rg addowner town sk89q <br>
			/rg removemember town g:builders <br>
			/rg removeowner town sk89q
		</mark>
	</center>
	</p>
	<p>
		Full documentation for these commands can be found on the Region Commands page.
	</p>
	<p><b>
		Example: Creating a spawn region where only the build team can build
	</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Create a region named “spawn”:</b><br>
			/rg define spawn</li>
		<li><b>Add the build team as a member:</b><br>
			/rg addmember spawn namesofmembers g:builders</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		2.2 Disable damages
	</h3>
	<p>
		We can change settings in spigot.yml including hunger, monster spawning and etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some detailed settings like fall damage and pvp are not in spigot.yml:
	</p>
	<p><mark>
		/rg flag NAMEOFYOURREGION list <br>
		To see a list of settings you can change. <br>
		E.g. to turn off fall damage <br>
		/rg flag NAMEOFYOURREGION fall-damage deny <br>
		To turn off pvp damage <br>
		/rg flag  NAMEOFYOURREGION pvp deny
	</mark></p>
