    <h2>1. For third party commissioners.</h2>
    <p>Q: I am interested to use this Imperial virtual world as a platform for my own society events, what steps should I follow?<br />
    <br />
    A: This virtual world is well developed and can be easily adapted for public events that conventionally happens on campus. <br />To access this vitual world, please have a look at <a href="client-setup.html">Client Setup</a> and <a href="admin.html">Administration</a>. For front end changes and developments, please check <a href="world-edit-guard.html">World Edit/Guard</a> and contact an admin by imperial_virtual_world@gmail.com so we can grant you construction permission and provide related support.<br /> If you would like to hold it on your own server, there might be some administration issues and please contact imperial_virtual_world@gmail.com for further details. Technically it is easy to set up a separate copy of this virtual world on another server.
